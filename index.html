        <h2 id="night-one">The First Night</h2>
        <p>
          The first night is tough because you essentially have one day to
          gather enough resources to build a beginner shelter, complete with a
          bed, and the equipment you'll need to hunt prey and defend from
          monsters. Once you conquer the first night, every night after that is
          (mostly) a piece of cake, besides the occasional creeper-induced death
          or oops-I-fell-from-a-really-high-place moments. Here's the order in
          which to tackle objectives in the first night, in order to set
          yourself up for long-term success. Every person who plays Minecraft
          will have to carry out the same basic tasks when they first start a
          game: punch some trees, expertly shape the wood fragments into a
          functional and portable workbench, and masterfully craft functional
          tools from the remains. Trust me, it's not as hard as it sounds in
          Minecraft. To get started, follow these steps: <br /><br />

          <strong>1</strong>. Find a tree and punch it down. Pick up the wood
          and make a crafting table in your inventory. Make some tools and start
          digging a tunnel slanted downwards until you find stone. Mine out a
          bit of it until you have enough for stone tools and a furnace.<br />
          <strong>2</strong>. Get some more wood and start making a little house
          with walls, a door, and a roof.

          When you get throught the end portal, you'll need to use the blocks
          you brought to scaffold over to the main island.
